# Data science portfolio - Valentino Saba

This is a collection of projects I've done so far. There are both projects I've created for courses and personal projects.

## Contents

### Data exploration, inferential statistics, linear regression
These project are written in R, and I completed them during the Statistics with R Specialization offered by Duke University on Coursera:
- Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset: [a simple exploration](https://github.com/bolent/Coursework/tree/main/brfss_dataset_exploration)
- General Social Surveys (GSS) dataset inference: [in 2012, does that appear to be a relationship between the race of each respondent and the social class in which they identify themselves?](https://github.com/bolent/Coursework/tree/main/gss_dataset_inference)
- Movies dataset question: [associations between the IMDB rating of a movie and a variety of other variables in the dataset](https://github.com/bolent/Coursework/tree/main/movies_dataset_regression)
